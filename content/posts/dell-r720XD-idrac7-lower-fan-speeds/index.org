* Preface
My rack server was destroying my eardrums with the fan speeds being
too high. I plan to replace the fans with Noctua's, but in the
meantime [[https://angrysysadmins.tech/index.php/2022/01/grassyloki/idrac-7-8-lower-fan-noise-on-dell-servers/][this fix works great.]] It's not silent, but much quieter.

* Commands
Run these commands inside of IDrac SSH

#+begin_src
racadm set system.thermalsettings.FanSpeedOffset 255
racadm set system.thermalsettings.ThirdPartyPCIFanResponse 0
racadm set system.thermalsettings.ThermalProfile 2
#+end_src

That's it! Still a little noisy but tolerable.
