* Frog Find
Frog find is a search engine used for old computers. Anything you search and any
link you click gets converted into HTML. A demo can be found on
[[https://search.unixfandom.com]].

* Installation
Here's how to install it. I'll show both the orginal link and my fork that
includes some custom CSS for margins.

#+begin_src 
apt install php php-xml composer git
git clone https://github.com/peterunix/FrogFind.git
cd FrogFind
composer update
php -S localhost:8000
#+end_src
