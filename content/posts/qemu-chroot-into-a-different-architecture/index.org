title: Qemu Chroot Into a Different Architecture
---

 Chrooting into systems with different architectures
* Preface
The qemu-user-static package provides several usermode emulation binaries.
We can copy these over to our chroot environment to emulate programs from a different architecture.

* Dependencies
The emulation binaries will be placed in /usr/bin/qemu-*-static.
These are standalone applications don't require dependencies.
The arch-install-scripts provide the "arch-chroot" wrapper script.
It handles mounting the psuedo filesystems (dev,proc,sys) so we don't have to.
#+begin_src shell
apt install qemu-user-static arch-install-scripts
#+end_src

* Chrooting
Here's me chrooting into Raspbian ARM.

#+begin_src shell
# Mounting raspbian paritions
mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/boot

# Copying emulation binary to raspbian path
cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /mnt/usr/bin

# Using qemu-arm-static to emulate the bash shell in chroot
arch-chroot /mnt qemu-arm-static /bin/bash
#+end_src
