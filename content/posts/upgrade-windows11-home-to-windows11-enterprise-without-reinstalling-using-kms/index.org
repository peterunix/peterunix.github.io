I didn't want to pay for a Windows 11 Pro product key and niether did
I want to wipe windows to re-install Windows 11 Pro. The KMS
activation keys I tried weren't working regardless of what I
tried. After about 30 minutes googling, I found a guide that
worked. Here it is!

* The meat
Open CMD.exe as an administrator and run the following commands. Note
that idk if the KMS8.msguides.com KMS server is necesarry. I did it
