* About
This page is going to get big!

I have ADHD and frequently have list items that either never get completed, or
even touched! I call these tasks "Operations", which I feel is fitting
considering how long it takes to complete one.

Each headline will have the date it was created, with the end goal of having
them all be complete

It went great! I didn't start my first day yet. I am likely to start with
Delivering food to a couple locations. After that I can assist with other areas.

Chris was a great feeling person. I sat and listened the entire time. He
reaffirmed that you are taking time out of your day to volunteer -- not
working. I understood that already and enjoyed hearing it.

He asked me to email when I am able to start working. I have to fit a single day
in my schedule to complete deliveries.

*** TASK Finding a schedule that works.
I need to find a day of the week that would be best for this.
My class starts at 5:30PM on Mondays and Wednesday. The Volunteer gig would be
from 1-4PM. If I get off work at 12PM, that gives me plenty of time to drive
home before and after work/volunteering/school.

Wednesday would be a good day.

I sent an email to the bosses about it.

CLOSED: [2025-08-19 Tue 13:24]

Called the Medical center for ADHD medication. The psychiatry office said I
would first need to try a course of antidepressants and anti anxiety medication.

I called the office of my primary care physician to schedule the first appt

*** TASK Attend Phone Appointment
Scheduled for the 25th of this month at 12PM. I don't know what to expect.

If I'm on anti-anxiety or anti-depressants, I hope it doesn't end my gumption to
do things.

** TODO Operazione/Gardening [0%]
*** GOAL
I have an entire backyard and a life that can potentially be filled to the top
with plants. I want to know how to grow primarily indoor plants for aesthetics
and warmth.

*** TASK What I will need
** TODO Operazione/Tattoo [0%]
/Entered on/ [2025-08-08 Fri 15:40]
*** Goal
Extend the sleeve to my rear Delt. I want it to cover my collar bone a little
and bleed away. I was thinking it would be nice to have the existing sleeve look
like its attached to my arm like an organic plant. Adventure time comes to
mind :)

*** TASK First appointment -- drafting the tattoo
The appointment is in the midst of scheduling. I'm slightly concerned on the
financial of things. I felt what needing money is like and I dont want to deal
with something as stupid as "needing more dollars" again.

** TODO Operazione/Guitar finger fun [%]
/Entered on/ [2025-07-10 Thu 12:41]

*** Goal
Learn the Guitar enough to be and find the satisfaction in playing it. I like
the thought of picking up a Guitar and not only enjoying the sounds, but also
enjoying seeing my muscle memory develop on my fingers.

*** TASK Clean the Guitar
*** TASK Restring the Guitar
*** TASK Pickup the guitar and play with it for 10 minutes
