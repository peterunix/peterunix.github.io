* About
This page is going to get big!

I have ADHD and frequently have list items that either never get completed, or
even touched! I call these tasks "Operations", which I feel is fitting
considering how long it takes to complete one.

Each headline will have the date it was created, with the end goal of having
them all be complete

It went great! I didn't start my first day yet. I am likely to start with
Delivering food to a couple locations. After that I can assist with other areas.

Chris was a great feeling person. I sat and listened the entire time. He
reaffirmed that you are taking time out of your day to volunteer -- not
working. I understood that already and enjoyed hearing it.

He asked me to email when I am able to start working. I have to fit a single day
in my schedule to complete deliveries.

*** TASK Finding a schedule that works.
I need to find a day of the week that would be best for this.
My class starts at 5:30PM on Mondays and Wednesday. The Volunteer gig would be
from 1-4PM. If I get off work at 12PM, that gives me plenty of time to drive
home before and after work/volunteering/school.

Wednesday would be a good day.

I sent an email to the bosses about it.

** TODO Operazione/Car checking [60%]
*** DONE Find Mechanic
CLOSED: [2025-08-20 Wed 09:55]
I called Chris's mechanic and I the wait time was too long.

I'm waiting on a call back from Personalized auto care:
1680 Mendocino Ave, Santa Rosa, CA 95401, US

UPDATE:
____________________________________________________________
Getting my tires replaced. I've texted the mechanic and he needs the tire sizes
on my car. The model number I sent wasn't correct

On the Side wall of my tires I'll need to get the code

Update:
____________________________________________________________
Sent the tire information. Scheduling now.

*** DONE Check oil and transmission fluid
CLOSED: [2025-08-24 Sun 15:41]
Oil filter and transmission fluid purchased. Arriving tomorrow <2025-08-22 Thu>

Update:
____________________________________________________________

The oil and transmission fluid was replaced! I got to speak with my mom and pops
again. For the first time, in at least a long time, it felt like the Dad I was
talking to was a real, reasonable, person. He was chill.

It was a good visit! I had slept for 12 hours that prior day and had some great
dreams. I woke up at 2PM. After that day, which lasted about 8 hours, I slept
again and have what I'd say are the best dreams ever. There was not a single
thing that went wrong in them.

I was alone in my dreams, but there was always someone there to communicate
with. No crazy dream issues. It was just me driving around, going to the store, etc.

*** TODO Replace windshield wipers
*** TODO Clean the interior

*** DONE Replace tires
CLOSED: [2025-08-22 Fri 13:36]
Done! That wasn't so bad. I pulled up to the shop and had the tires placed
within the our. My brother drove us back to the house to make snacks and gossip.

** TODO Operazione/Gardening [0%]
*** GOAL
I have an entire backyard and a life that can potentially be filled to the top
with plants. I want to know how to grow primarily indoor plants for aesthetics
and warmth.

** TODO Operazione/Tattoo [0%]
/Entered on/ [2025-08-08 Fri 15:40]
*** Goal
Extend the sleeve to my rear Delt. I want it to cover my collar bone a little
and bleed away. I was thinking it would be nice to have the existing sleeve look
like its attached to my arm like an organic plant. Adventure time comes to
mind :)

*** TASK First appointment -- drafting the tattoo
The appointment is in the midst of scheduling. I'm slightly concerned on the
financial of things. I felt what needing money is like and I dont want to deal
with something as stupid as "needing more dollars" again.

** TODO Operazione/Guitar finger fun [0%]
/Entered on/ [2025-07-10 Thu 12:41]

*** Goal
Learn the Guitar enough to be and find the satisfaction in playing it. I like
the thought of picking up a Guitar and not only enjoying the sounds, but also
enjoying seeing my muscle memory develop on my fingers.

*** TASK Clean the Guitar
*** TASK Restring the Guitar
*** TASK Pickup the guitar and play with it for 10 minutes
*** TASK Install the guitar mount
Dan gifted me a guitar holder! Install this bad boy.

I cancelled this. I was going to start on antidepressents, antianxiety meds, and
others before being prescribed for ADHD. I may add more to this eventually. For
now I'd like to wait. This is listed here so i get my medicine medicine

Update! <2025-08-22 Fri>

I learned I can order this online instead of going through the Amazon
pharmacy...there is an alternate reality in which I didn't wait 3 weeks to spend
5 minutes ordering.
