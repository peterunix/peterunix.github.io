title: Bspwm Dynamic Borders When Toggling Fullscreen
---


* Preface
Dynamically change the border size when there is either a single node
or multiple nodes on the focused desktop

Add "/path/to/script &" to your BSPWMRC to make use of this script

#+begin_src shell
#!/bin/sh
# Border size when there is one node on desktop and when there are multiple node
s
single_node="0"
multi_node="3"

# Create named pipe
dynamicborder_fifo='/tmp/dynamic-border.fifo'
[ -e "$dynamicborder_fifo" ] && rm "$dynamicborder_fifo"
mkfifo "$dynamicborder_fifo"

# Subscribe to bspc events
bspc subscribe desktop > "$dynamicborder_fifo" &
bspc subscribe node > "$dynamicborder_fifo" &

# Change border size if there is one node or multiple nodes on focused desktop
_DynamicBorder(){
        focused=$(bspc query -D --names -d focused)
        node=$(bspc query -N -d $focused | wc -l)
        [ $node -eq 1 ] && bspc config border_width $single_node || bspc config border_width $multi_node
}

# Reading stdin from named pipe
_Main(){
        while read -r report; do
                case $report in
                        *) _DynamicBorder;;
                esac
