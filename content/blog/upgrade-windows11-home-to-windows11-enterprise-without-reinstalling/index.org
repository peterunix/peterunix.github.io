* Preface
I didn't want to pay for a Windows 11 Pro product key and niether did
I want to wipe windows to re-install Windows 11 Pro. The KMS
activation keys I tried weren't working . After about 30 minutes
googling, I found a guide that worked. Here it is!

* Applying the generic license key
Open CMD.exe as an administrator and run the following commands.

Windows will automatically start upgrading to Windows 11 Enterprise
after this. Note that this is a generic license key used for the
upgrade and the actual OS won't be properly licensed.

* Licensing Windows
Now you can use Mass Gravel to license the software.
