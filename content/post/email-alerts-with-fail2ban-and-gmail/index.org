* Preface
Here's how to setup Fail2ban to send email alerts through GMAIL when
failed SSH authentications are made. I'm not going to be too detailed
on this but I'll provide the link to setting up Exim4 along with my
jail.local config for SSH. Exim4 doesn't have OAUTH2.0 support so
you'll have to use app passwords. You can probably write your own
python program that can handle OATH2.0

There are two parts to this:
1. Setup something to send emails (exim4)
2. Tell Fail2ban to run a command to send the email

* Setup SMTP Client
Follow this guide to setup EXIM4 with Gmail and App Passwords

* Fail2Ban Jail Config
/etc/fail2ban/jail.local
#+begin_src
[DEFAULT]
ignoreip = 127.0.0.0
findtime = 2m
maxretry = 8
bantime = 10m
destemail = DESTINATION@EXAMPLE.com
sender =  SENDER@EXAMPLE.com
action = %(action_mwl)s

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 22
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
actionban = printf %%b "Hi,\n
            The IP <ip> has just been banned by Fail2Ban after
            <failures> attempts against <name>.\n
            Regards,\n
            Fail2Ban" | mail -s "Subject: [Fail2Ban] <name>: banned <ip> from <fq-hostname> "
#+end_src

* Done
For troubleshooting make sure the "mail" command works on its own. You
should be good to go.
