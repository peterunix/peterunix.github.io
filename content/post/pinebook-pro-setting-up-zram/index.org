title: Pinebook Pro Setting Up Zram
---

* Preface
ZRAM is essentially compressed memory. Your system uses some of it's
CPU cycles to compress redundant data into a reserved area of your ram.
Think of it as swap space, but without writing to your drive.
I've tested this on both Manjaro Arm and Archlinux Arm.


* Checking if ZRAM is supported

#+begin_src shell
$ insmod | grep zram

Output: zram    ????? ?
#+end_src

If you get similar results, zram should be supported.

* Setting up ZRAM
 
 #+begin_src shell
 sudo modprobe zram && sudo zramctl -a lzo-rle -s 12G zram0
 #+end_src
 
 Here we are choosing the compression algorithm and size of the zram device.
 Next we tell our system to use it as swap.
 
 #+begin_src shell
 sudo mkswap /dev/zram0 && sudo swapon /dev/zram0
 #+end_src
 
We should be good to go. Here's how you can verify zram is being used.

 #+begin_src shell
free -h
 
total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:         3.7Gi       429Mi     2.7Gi        30Mi       562Mi
Swap:        11Gi          0B        11Gi
 #+end_src
