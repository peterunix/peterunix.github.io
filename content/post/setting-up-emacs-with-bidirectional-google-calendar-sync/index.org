---

* Synopsis
This guide will use Emacs 30 (optionally) and [[https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el/][org-gcal by Kidd]] to setup
bidirectional calendar syncing between your org agenda and google.

I'm using the following Emacs app image: [[https://github.com/blahgeek/emacs-appimage/releases/tag/github-action-build-12425294048][LINK]]

Overview of steps:
- Create a new app on the Google Developer Console
- Install org-gcal from straight
- Add your API keys
- Sync Calendar

The guide on the Kidd's README is incredibly detailed. I'll be copying most of it and
including the solutions that left me with a working system.

* Creating the Google App

- Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager
- Create a new project named "Emacs G-CAL"
- Click on the top left hamburger menu
- Select "API & Services>OAuth Consent Screen"

Create an external app

[[https://paste.fe00.xyz/Nb2G/image.png]]

Give it a name such as "Emacs G-CAL". The rest of the settings can be left as
default. *Add your email address as a test user before completing the setup*.

[[https://paste.fe00.xyz/yZgB/image.png]]

[[https://paste.fe00.xyz/pkMF/image.png]]

Next create the API credentials

- Click on Credentials>Create Credentials>Create OAuth Client ID

[[https://paste.fe00.xyz/y8BS/Screenshot%202025-01-17%20195615.png]]

Application type is desktop. Copy your client ID and client secret to a text
file.after completing this step.

The last step is to enable the Google Calendar API for the project
- Click on Enabled API and Services
- Click on Enable API
- Scroll down to "Google Calendar" and enable it

* Locating Calendar ID
Your Google calendar ID will be a set in a variable when installing org-gcal in
Emacs. This is how to find it and please write it down.

Navigate to your google calendar settings and scroll down to the
integration/sharing settings. There will be links to the ISC calendars for
sharing, as well as a section that says *Calendar ID*

For Gmail Personal accounts at least, the *Calendar ID* will be your email address
address. Write down your *Calendar ID*

* Adding org-gcal to Emacs

I'm using straight.el to install org-gcal. This is my package management code
block for reference.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Package manager setup
(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(setq package-check-signature nil)
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                         ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") ))
(package-initialize)
(unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

;; Package manager. Install Straight.el
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name
        "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"
        (or (bound-and-true-p straight-base-dir)
            user-emacs-directory)))
      (bootstrap-version 7))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

;; Package manager. Install use-package with straight.el
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
(setq straight-use-package-by-default t)
(setf use-package-always-ensure t)

;; Package Manager. Install quelpa using use-package
(use-package quelpa-use-package
  :ensure t
  :pin melpa
  :init
  (setq quelpa-update-melpa-p nil))
#+end_src


This is the official way of installing org-gcal. For the rest of this guide,
I'll be using a slightly modified version that provides basic security for
storing the API Keys. Please acknowledge this code block, but don't use it if
you're following along.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
# THIS IS ONLY A WORKING EXAMPLE. KEEP READING PAGE
  (use-package org-gcal
    :ensure t
    :config
    (require 'org-gcal)
    (require 'plstore)
    (setq plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)
    (setq org-gcal-client-id "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
          org-gcal-client-secret "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
          org-gcal-fetch-file-alist '(("YOUR_CALENDAR_ID" .  "~/.emacs.d/calendar.org")))
    (org-gcal-reload-client-id-secret)
    )
#+end_src


Org-gcal relies on using plstore which stores key value pairs in an encrypted
file using GPG. The purpose of the plstore is to read the ~org-gcal-client-id~ and
~org-gcal-client-secret~, and then use an oauth2.0 library to request the xoauth2.0
token. The token is then encrypted in a file located in
~$HOME/.emacs.d/oauth2-auto.plist~. Anytime you sync your calendar, that file will
be decrypted and used for authentication.

I'll start with creating a passwordless GPG keypair. This is required by my
email client. You don't strictly need a passwordless key pair. ~Pass~ is used to
store the client ID and secret keys in encrypted files. In my init.el, I'll tell
emacs to decrypt the files for the variables. Additionally, I'll tell plstore to
encrypt using my key-pair instead of using symmetric encryption. This avoids
hard coded API keys and password prompts when syncing.

Start with creating the GPG key pair and then encrypting your Client ID and
Client Secret ID. These encrypted files will automatically be stored in ~$HOME/.password-store/g-cal/~

#+begin_src bash
apt install pass
gpg --batch --passphrase '' --quick-gen-key proton@proton.local default default

pass init proton@proton.local

pass insert g-cal/clientid
<PASTE Client ID Here>

pass insert g-cal/clientsecret
<PASTE Client Secret ID Here>
#+end_src

Now use this code snippet to install GCal.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-gcal
    :ensure t
    :config
    (require 'org-gcal)
    (require 'plstore)
    (setq plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)
    (setq org-gcal-client-id (string-trim (shell-command-to-string "pass g-cal/clientid"))
          org-gcal-client-secret (string-trim (shell-command-to-string "pass g-cal/clientsecret"))
          org-gcal-fetch-file-alist '(("YOUR_CALENDAR_ID" . "~/.emacs.d/calendar.org")))
    (setq plstore-encrypt-to "proton@proton.local")
    (org-gcal-reload-client-id-secret)
    )
#+end_src

* Syncing Your Calendar
This part can be tedious. I'll include steps for troubleshooting.

Firstly, ensure your org agenda files are set.

#+begin_src 
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/.emacs.d/calendar.org"))
(setq org-default-agenda-file "~/.emacs.d/calendar.org")
#+end_src

Now create the ~$HOME/.emacs.d/oauth2-auto.plist~ file. For an unknown reason,
the plstore module will fail to create the encrypted oauth2-auto.plist file
unless it already exists. Create this file manually before attempting the g-cal
sync/google sign in window:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
touch $HOME/.emacs.d/oauth2-auto.plist
#+end_src

Open Emacs and run the following command

#+begin_src
# If the sync ever fails, run this before attempting to resync
M-x org-gcal--sync-unlock

M-x org-gcal-sync
#+end_src

This will attempt to open your default web browser. Complete the "sign in with
google" consent screen and close the window. Emacs will retrieve the xoauth2.0
token after closing the window, then encrypt it into that file.

*If you have a prompt requesting to kill the xoauth2.0 buffer, click "Save and
 kill buffer"*.

Run the sync again. This time it should should download your email events into
your agenda/calendar file.

#+begin_src 
M-x org-gcal-sync
#+end_src

Your calendar should be synced at this point!

* Automatically Sync Calendar

This code will automatically sync the calendar bi-directionally with Google
every 30 seconds. Minibuffer dialog will be suppressed

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun make-silent (func &rest args) (cl-letf (((symbol-function 'message) (lambda (&rest args) nil))) (apply func args))) ; Silently run other functions.

(use-package org-gcal ; Installing org-gcal and configuring
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)
  (setq org-gcal-client-id (string-trim (shell-command-to-string "pass g-cal/clientid")))
  (setq org-gcal-client-secret (string-trim (shell-command-to-string "pass g-cal/clientsecret")))
  (setq org-gcal-fetch-file-alist `(("email@gmail.com" . ,(expand-file-name "calendar.org" user-emacs-directory))))
  (setq plstore-encrypt-to "proton@proton.local")
  )

(defun my-org-gcal-sync-clear-token ()
  "Sync calendar, clearing tokens first."
  (interactive)
  (require 'org-gcal)
  (when org-gcal--sync-lock
    ;; Avoids displaying the org-sync-lock error
    (org-gcal--sync-unlock))
  (org-gcal-reload-client-id-secret)
  (org-gcal-sync-tokens-clear)
  (org-gcal-sync))

; Make the g-cal sync function silent
(advice-add 'my-org-gcal-sync-clear-token :around #'make-silent)

; Only attempt automatic sync if the OATH2 credential file exists.
(when (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "oauth2-auto.plist" user-emacs-directory))
  (org-gcal-reload-client-id-secret) ; Reload the client and secret ID variables
  (run-at-time 0 30 #'my-org-gcal-sync-clear-token) ; Run the sync
  )
#+end_src

* Org Capture Template

Per the README, this is the official way to use org capture. I learned its
easiest to write dates in the format "Jan 1 23:00" when scheduling items. Read
the documentation for any information on how the application works.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        `(("a" "Appointment" entry (file ,(concat user-emacs-directory "/calendar.org"))
           "* %?\n:PROPERTIES:\n:calendar-id:\tpeteruxfdm@gmail.com\n:END:\n:org-gcal:\n%^T--%^T\n:END:\n\n" :jump-to-captured t)
          ("j" "Journal" entry (file org-default-journal-file)
           "** %? %U\n\n"
           :empty-lines 1)
          ))
#+end_src

* Troubleshooting
Scenario: The sync is completing without error though no calendar events are populating.

Solution: Create a new calendar event item first and see if that syncs. My
calendar took a while to retrieve future and past events. I was under the
impression that only new calendar event items would appear. All of your events
will appear, though sometimes it can take a moment.

If the sync fails, run these commands and try again. This is also applicable to
if you receive an oauth provider error. Running the reload command will fix
that as well:

#+begin_src 
M-x (org-gcal-reload-client-id-secret)
M-x (org-gcal--sync-unlock)
M-x (org-gcal-sync)
#+end_src

Scenario: Sync failing in general

Solution: It could be that your API credentials are incorrect Try steps above
after confirming the credentials are correct. Double check that your
oauth2-auto.plist file in the emacs-user-directory contains data. This should
contain encrypted PGP data. If it doesn't, read your emacs error logs and enable
org-gcal-toggle-debugging. This will indicate whether its an issue creating the
file or with the API server.

I have tried clicking on "~yes~", "~no~", and "~save then kill~" when first running
~org-gcal-sync~ and receiving the ~oauth2-auto.plist~ buffer message. I believe if
you click "save then kill", it will properly save the PGP encrypted file that
emacs creates.

If the file contains valid PGP data and the message buffer says its getting
decrypted, its another problem with either the API or the sync being
delayed. Please try creating new calendar event items specifically when
troubleshooting.

The steps above should "just work". Additional issues would need individual
troubleshooting.
