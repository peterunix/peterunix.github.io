<h1>Easter EGG!!!</h1>
<p>Hi there! I can't afford a parking pass at the moment. Money has been tight during this time in life, and I have to prioritize putting food on the table for at least a few more weeks</p>
<p>I hope you find it in that grand heart to allow this vehicle to stay until I can afford the permit</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
